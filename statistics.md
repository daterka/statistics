## _**STATISTICS BASICS**_

### **Concepts**

* population - collection of individuals (similar items/events) = statistical dataset
* sample - is a set of individuals selected from population by a defined procedure (subset of population)
* distribution - listing/function showing **all possible values** (or intervals) for population and how often they **occure** 
    * for categorized data - show number or percentage of individuals in each group 
    * for numerical data - data ordered from smalest to largest and broken into groups, then put into charts and plots to examine shape, center and amount of variability in the data
    *  

### **Numerical measures**

* parameter - numerical descriptive measure calculated for population
* statistic - numerical descriptive measure calculated for sample

* measures of center - a **measure** along the horizontal axis of data distribution **that locates the center of the distribution**
  * arithmetic mean / avarage **x̄** (x-bar) - sum of all measurements divided by their number
    * more easily affected by extreamly large/small values
  * **μ** (Greeks "mu") - population mean
  * median - middle element of sorted sequence of measurments, position = **.5(n+1)**
    * often used as a center if the distribution is skewed
  * mode - most frequent value of measurements set (possible no mode, bimodal, trimodal, etc.)

* measures of variability - a **measure** along the horizontal axis of data distribution **that describes the spread of the distribution from the center** 
  * range - difference between largest and smallest measurement ("difference length")
  * variance (**$σ^2$**, Greeks *sigma*) -  measure of variability in the whole data set, it measure the average deviation of measurements about their mean
    * variance of N size population - is an avarage of squared deviations of measurements about their mean μ :
       ### $σ^2 = \frac{∑(xi - μ)^2}{N}$
    * variance of n size sample - is a sume of squares of deviations of measurements about their mean devided by n-1 :
       ### $s^2 = \frac{∑(xi-x̄)^2}{n-1}$ 
      * the larger $s/s^2$ the larger the variability of the data set
      * n-1 in denominator provides better estimation of population standard deviation σ 
    * standard deviation - the positive square root of the deviations
      * population standard deviation : $σ = \sqrt{σ^2}$
      * sample standard deviation : $s = \sqrt{s^2}$
